The organization %(ORG)s doesn't exist; you have to create it.
The rest of this text walks you through how to do that.

Open a browser window and login to Github. On your home page, there
is a plus sign in the upper-right corner.  Click it and select
"New organization" and fill in the following fields:
    Organization name
	    ietf-wg-%(WGNAME)s
    Billing email
	    Your email address
    Choose your plan
	    Use the Free plan
Click "Create organization" at the bottom of the page.

You'll then get to invite members; skip that and just click "Finish"

Final step is to fill in the meta-data about the project.  Click on the
"Settings" tab.  You will leave many of these blank as the script
will then update them.
    URL
    	https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/%(WGNAME)s

You should upload a picture.  The file ietf-logo.jpeg is probably a sanctioned
use of the IETF trademark (we're working to make it officially so).  Click
"Update profile."  You'll be brought back to the settings page, and you can
now close the window.

After doing those things, re-run this script.
