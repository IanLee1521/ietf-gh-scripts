The organization %(ORG)s doesn't exist; you have to create it.
The rest of this text walks you through how to do that.

Open a browser window and login to Github. On your home page, there
is a plus sign in the upper-right corner.  Click it and select
"New organization" and fill in the following fieldsa:
    Organization name
	    ietf-wg-$(WGNAME)s
    Billing email
	    Your email address
    Choose your plan
	    Use the Free plan
Click "Create organization" at the bottom of the page.

You'll then get to invite members; skip that and just click "Finish"

Final step is to fill in the meta-data about the project.  Click on the
"Settings" tab.  You will leave many of these blank as the script
will then update them.
    URL
    	https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/%(WGNAME)s

You should upload a picture.  Probably by default something like the
IETF logo.  Github is a square and the logo is rectangular so it's not
great.  You can use ietf-logo.jpeg if you want; it's legal use of the
trademark. Then click "Update profile."

You can then re-run this script.
